# Feature-Extraction

Python , Sckit-learn, Numpy , Pandas

In this project, Clustered all the documents of the Reuters corpus dataset using the k-means algorithm. Cluster quality was measured using the Homogeneity score.Features were extracted for each cluster through auto encoders and accuracy was measured using different classification algorithms. Deep neural networks has the highest accuracy rate of 89.21\% comapred to other algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, etc.
